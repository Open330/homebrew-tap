  def caveats
    <<~CAVEATS
      'barshelf upgrade' updates the app and the CLI together, but it detects a
      Homebrew-installed CLI and refuses to replace it — writing into the Cellar
      would leave brew holding the version it installed, and the next upgrade
      would revert yours. Use 'brew upgrade barshelf-cli' instead.
