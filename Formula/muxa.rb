  def caveats
    <<~CAVEATS
      Upgrading does not replace a muxad that is already running: the
      new binary lands on disk, and the live process keeps serving
      from the old one. This version of muxad notices the swap on its
      own and re-execs onto the new build within about 30 seconds.

      To pick it up immediately, or after disabling that in
      [daemon] restart_on_new_binary:

        muxa daemon restart

      Run 'muxa doctor' if anything looks stale; it reports a daemon
      whose version has drifted from the CLI's.
